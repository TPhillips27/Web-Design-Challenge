        <h1>Breweries Visited</h1>
        <p>
            Wherever I go I try to visit as many breweries as possible, or at least the best in the  area. 
            It's a great way to try an infinite amount of new beers, take in the atmosphere, talk to strangers,
            and just enjoy supporting a local business. A great part about visiting breweries is that even though
            the process of making beer is 'roughly' the same, it's amazing how much the quality of beer can vary.
            I've used visiting breweries as a great way to explore North Carolina. Want to explore RDU? Want to explore the 
            coast? Want to explore the mountains? Passing through a rural area? There are breweries literally everywhere
            and they all must be visited! What was surprising to me was that I have been to more breweries in Vermont than
            New Jersey. I spent 7 years in Jersey while of the legal drinking age.  I've spent a total of about 10 days in Vermont, 
            and yet I was able to go to 4 more breweries in Vermont than New Jersey. However, the quality of the Vermont beer
            that I experienced was far greater than what could be produced in New Jersey.
